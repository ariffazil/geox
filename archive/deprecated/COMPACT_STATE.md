## Quick Reference

```bash
# Test closed-loop system
python tests/test_closed_loop.py

# Start Trinity Dashboard
python scripts/trinity_dashboard.py --monitor

# Execute skill (dry run)
python -c "import asyncio; from core.skill_bridge import execute_skill; asyncio.run(execute_skill('vps-docker', 'check_status', {}, 'test', True))"
```

## 4 Gaps Status: ALL CLOSED

| Gap | Component | Status |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| **Reality (R)** | Reality Bridge | ✅ CLOSED - All 9 skills wired |
| **Truth (T)** | Execution Validator | ✅ CLOSED - Hash + diff verification |
| **Witness (W)** | W3 Integration | ✅ CLOSED - Real execution feeds W3 |
| **Authority (A)** | F13 Override | ✅ CLOSED - Operator identity required |

## Enhanced Execution Validator

### Features Added
1. **Hash Verification** - SHA256 content hashing
2. **State Diff** - unified_diff comparison
3. **Integrity Score** - 0.0 to 1.0 accuracy metric
4. **Snapshot System** - Pre/post state comparison

### Usage
```python
from core.execution_validator import validate

result = validate(
    expected={"stdout": "expected output", "verification_hash": "abc123"},
    actual={"success": True, "returncode": 0, "stdout": "actual output"},
    session_id="test",
    compute_diff=True  # Enable detailed diff
)

# Access results
print(f"W3: {result.w3_score}")
print(f"Integrity: {result.verification.integrity_score}")
print(f"Hash Match: {result.verification.hash_match}")
if result.state_diff:
    print(f"Added: {len(result.state_diff.added)}")
    print(f"Removed: {len(result.state_diff.removed)}")
```
