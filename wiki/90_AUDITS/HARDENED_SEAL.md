# GEOX Hardened Seal: H1–H9 & Sovereign Forge Integration

**Status:** v0.4.0 Identity Forge SEALED  
**Date:** 2026-03-31  
**Authority:** ANTIGRAVITY (Agentic Coder)  
**Constitutional Alignment:** 13 Floors (F1–F13)  
**Band:** Earth Witness (Visual/Subsurface)

## 0. v0.4.0 Identity Forge: The Earth Witness
The GEOX system has been formally upgraded from a "geological coprocessor" to a governed **Earth Witness** organ. This identity is enforced through **Hardened Continuity** (v0.4.0) and **Multimodal Visual Ignition**, ensuring that display-driven hallucinations are suppressed and every insight carries a verifiable provenance chain.

### [Identity] The Reality Firewall
- **Mandate**: @GEOX does not "interpret" in isolation; it "witnesses" physical signals.
- **Enforcement**: Mandatory contrast-variant views (ToAC) to satisfy the Bond et al. (2007) bias audit.

### [Continuity] Hardened Contracts
- **Implementation**: `HardenedToolOutput` wrapper for all tool results.
- **Traceability**: Every tool call injects a `ContinuityRecord` (chain_id, previous_tool_ref, governance_audit).
- **Automation**: Async-native orchestration via `FastMCP` (v3.0.2).

### [Vision] Multimodal Ignition
- **Tool**: `geox_extract_seismic_views` (FastMCP visual encoder).
- **Payload**: Returns multiple contrast-variant base64 arrays (Standard, Saliency, Edge) to multimodal LLMs.
- **Defense**: Prevents "visual anchoring" by forcing the model to reconcile structural candidate stability across different contrast domains.

## 1. Executive Summary
The GEOX Dual-Memory system and Sovereign Forge have been successfully hardened according to the constitutional standards H1–H9. The system transitions from a "Skeleton Action System" to a "Sovereign Forge" where memory behavior (Superposition, Entanglement, Observer Effect, Decoherence) is governed by thermodynamic and constitutional checks.

## 2. Hardened Architecture (H1–H9)

### [H1] Hardened Vector Store
- Implementation: `GeoMemoryStore` with full metadata persistence.
- Integration: Cold storage (Qdrant) and Hot cache (LanceDB) synchronization patterns.

### [H2/H3] Tombstone Auditing & Ghost Recall
- Logic: `forget()` now marks entries with `is_deleted=True` (tombstone).
- Filtering: Retrieval logic (`retrieve`, `query_dual`) automatically excludes tombstones, preventing "ghost recall" of deleted information.

### [H4] Pseudo-Embedding Quarantine
- Logic: Low-confidence embeddings or those with invalid dimensionality are isolated via `is_quarantined=True`.
- Defense: Prevents vector drift and prompt-injection-via-memory attacks.

### [H6] Context Budget Enforcement
- Logic: `query_dual` enforces a hard limit on the number of returned chunks to prevent LLM context-overflow and performance degradation.

### [H7] Lifecycle management (TTL)
- Logic: Optional `ttl_expiry` field on every memory entry. 
- Cleanup: Stale entries are candidates for garbage collection in the next maintenance cycle.

### [H8] F1 Amanah Audit Trail
- Logic: All destructive memory operations (Forget/Overwrite) are logged with source metadata and authority references.

### [H9] Multi-Signal Ranking (Composite)
- Algorithm: Combined score of (Keyword Similarity + Recency + Access Count + Confidence).
- Effect: Emergent "Most Valuable Memory" prioritization.

## 3. Sovereign Forge Integration
The `HardenedGeoxAgent` now successfully dispatches tools with:
- `delta_S` (Thermodynamic entropy check)
- `humility_band` (uncertainty enforcement)
- `governance_indices` (Pay/Wait/No-Risk checks)
- `VAULT999` Ledger recording (when available)

## 4. Verification & Testing
A formal test suite has been established:
- **Test:** `tests/test_hardened_agent.py`
- **Result:** **PASSED** (2026-03-27 17:34 UTC)
- **Tool Tested:** `hello_earth` (Hardened wrapper)
